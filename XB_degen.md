# XB degen
* Goal: evaluate evidence for degen ancestral Y and explore whether there is a turnover in the west
* Use genomic seqs mapped to XL to estimate polymorphism and dNdS in XB M and F
* Could explore sex-linkage in West Kenya samples using existing RADseq or with new GBS
* If new data, could add samples from SE Kenya near Kilimanjaro
* Drawback: best case scenario would include analysis of a family from west Kenya.
* Could use RADseq data to test whether west is fixed for W
